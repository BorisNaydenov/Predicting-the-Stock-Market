# Predicting-the-Stock-Market-  

## No investment advice and do not try to time the market without me.  

1. I am predicting stock market's possible return based on bonds historical movement.
2. Exploring the S&amp;P500 from a financial and macroeconomic perspective.
3. I focus on descriptive statistics and building a regression model.
4. Pleasure creating charts and discovering a mistake in a book.
