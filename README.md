# Predicting-the-Stock-Market-  

## No investment advice and do not try to time the market without me.  

1. I am predicting stock market's return based on bonds' historical movement.
2. Exploring the S&amp;P500 from a financial and macroeconomic perspective.
3. I focus on descriptive statistics and building a regression model.
4. The tool used for Data preparation is Excel.
5. Eviews (econometric software similar to Stata or SPSS) for statistical analysis
6. Results show that there is predicting power in the model.
7. The model should be used with caution and under consideration of economic circumstances.
8. Pleasure creating charts and discovering a mistake in a book.

⚡ Fun fact: I discovered a mistake in the Finance and Investments student's book. 

⚡So the "Fun fact" shows my critical thinking skill but is it a fun fact?
